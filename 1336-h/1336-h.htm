<h2>SHELLEY: AN ESSAY</h2>
<p>The Church, which was once the mother of poets no less than of saints,
during the last two centuries has relinquished to aliens the chief glories
of poetry, if the chief glories of holiness she has preserved for her
own.&nbsp; The palm and the laurel, Dominic and Dante, sanctity and
song, grew together in her soil: she has retained the palm, but forgone
the laurel.&nbsp; Poetry in its widest sense, <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a>
and when not professedly irreligious, has been too much and too long
among many Catholics either misprised or distrusted; too much and too
generally the feeling has been that it is at best superfluous, at worst
pernicious, most often dangerous.&nbsp; Once poetry was, as she should
be, the lesser sister and helpmate of the Church; the minister to the
mind, as the Church to the soul.&nbsp; But poetry sinned, poetry fell;
and, in place of lovingly reclaiming her, Catholicism cast her from
the door to follow the feet of her pagan seducer.&nbsp; The separation
has been ill for poetry; it has not been well for religion.</p>
<p>Fathers of the Church (we would say), pastors of the Church, pious
laics of the Church: you are taking from its walls the panoply of Aquinas&mdash;take
also from its walls the psaltery of Alighieri.&nbsp; Unroll the precedents
of the Church&rsquo;s past; recall to your minds that Francis of Assisi
was among the precursors of Dante; that sworn to Poverty he forswore
not Beauty, but discerned through the lamp Beauty the Light God; that
he was even more a poet in his miracles than in his melody; that poetry
clung round the cowls of his Order.&nbsp; Follow his footsteps; you
who have blessings for men, have you no blessing for the birds?&nbsp;
Recall to your memory that, in their minor kind, the love poems of Dante
shed no less honour on Catholicism than did the great religious poem
which is itself pivoted on love; that in singing of heaven he sang of
Beatrice&mdash;this supporting angel was still carven on his harp even
when he stirred its strings in Paradise.&nbsp; What you theoretically
know, vividly realise: that with many the religion of beauty must always
be a passion and a power, that it is only evil when divorced from the
worship of the Primal Beauty.&nbsp; Poetry is the preacher to men of
the earthly as you of the Heavenly Fairness; of that earthly fairness
which God has fashioned to His own image and likeness.&nbsp; You proclaim
the day which the Lord has made, and Poetry exults and rejoices in it.&nbsp;
You praise the Creator for His works, and she shows you that they are
very good.&nbsp; Beware how you misprise this potent ally, for hers
is the art of Giotto and Dante: beware how you misprise this insidious
foe, for hers is the art of modern France and of Byron.&nbsp; Her value,
if you know it not, God knows, and know the enemies of God.&nbsp; If
you have no room for her beneath the wings of the Holy One, there is
place for her beneath the webs of the Evil One: whom you discard, he
embraces; whom you cast down from an honourable seat, he will advance
to a haughty throne; the brows you dislaurel of a just respect, he will
bind with baleful splendours; the stone which you builders reject, he
will make his head of the corner.&nbsp; May she not prophesy in the
temple? then there is ready for her the tripod of Delphi.&nbsp; Eye
her not askance if she seldom sing directly of religion: the bird gives
glory to God though it sings only of its innocent loves.&nbsp; Suspicion
creates its own cause; distrust begets reason for distrust.&nbsp; This
beautiful, wild, feline Poetry, wild because left to range the wilds,
restore to the hearth of your charity, shelter under the rafter of your
Faith; discipline her to the sweet restraints of your household, feed
her with the meat from your table, soften her with the amity of your
children; tame her, fondle her, cherish her&mdash;you will no longer
then need to flee her.&nbsp; Suffer her to wanton, suffer her to play,
so she play round the foot of the Cross!</p>
<p>There is a change of late years: the Wanderer is being called to
her Father&rsquo;s house, but we would have the call yet louder, we
would have the proffered welcome more unstinted.&nbsp; There are still
stray remnants of the old intolerant distrust.&nbsp; It is still possible
for even a French historian of the Church to enumerate among the articles
cast upon Savonarola&rsquo;s famous pile, <i>po&eacute;sies &eacute;rotiques,
tant des anciens que des modernes, livres impies ou corrupteurs, Ovide,
Tibulle, Properce, pour ne nommer que les plus connus, Dante, P&eacute;trarque,
Boccace, tous ces auteurs Italiens qui d&eacute;j&agrave; souillaient
les &acirc;mes et ruinaient les moeurs, en cr&eacute;ant ou perfectionnant
la langue</i>. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2">{2}</a>&nbsp;
Blameworthy carelessness at the least, which can class the <i>Vita Nuova</i>
with the <i>Ars Amandi</i> and the <i>Decameron</i>!&nbsp; And among
many English Catholics the spirit of poetry is still often received
with a restricted Puritanical greeting, rather than with the traditionally
Catholic joyous openness.</p>
<p>We ask, therefore, for a larger interest, not in purely Catholic
poetry, but in poetry generally, poetry in its widest sense.&nbsp; With
few exceptions, whatsoever in our best poets is great and good to the
non-Catholic, is great and good also to the Catholic; and though Faber
threw his edition of Shelley into the fire and never regretted the act;
though, moreover, Shelley is so little read among us that we can still
tolerate in our Churches the religious parody which Faber should have
thrown after his three-volumed Shelley; <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a>&mdash;in
spite of this, we are not disposed to number among such exceptions that
straying spirit of light.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>We have among us at the present day no lineal descendant, in the
poetical order, of Shelley; and any such offspring of the aboundingly
spontaneous Shelley is hardly possible, still less likely, on account
of the defect by which (we think) contemporary poetry in general, as
compared with the poetry of the early nineteenth century, is mildewed.&nbsp;
That defect is the predominance of art over inspiration, of body over
soul.&nbsp; We do not say the <i>defect</i> of inspiration.&nbsp; The
warrior is there, but he is hampered by his armour.&nbsp; Writers of
high aim in all branches of literature, even when they are not&mdash;as
Mr. Swinburne, for instance, is&mdash;lavish in expression, are generally
over-deliberate in expression.&nbsp; Mr. Henry James, delineating a
fictitious writer clearly intended to be the ideal of an artist, makes
him regret that he has sometimes allowed himself to take the second-best
word instead of searching for the best.&nbsp; Theoretically, of course,
one ought always to try for the best word.&nbsp; But practically, the
habit of excessive care in word-selection frequently results in loss
of spontaneity; and, still worse, the habit of always taking the best
word too easily becomes the habit of always taking the most ornate word,
the word most removed from ordinary speech.&nbsp; In consequence of
this, poetic diction has become latterly a kaleidoscope, and one&rsquo;s
chief curiosity is as to the precise combinations into which the pieces
will be shifted.&nbsp; There is, in fact, a certain band of words, the
Pr&aelig;torian cohorts of poetry, whose prescriptive aid is invoked
by every aspirant to the poetical purple, and without whose prescriptive
aid none dares aspire to the poetical purple; against these it is time
some banner should be raised.&nbsp; Perhaps it is almost impossible
for a contemporary writer quite to evade the services of the free-lances
whom one encounters under so many standards. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4">{4}</a>&nbsp;
But it is at any rate curious to note that the literary revolution against
the despotic diction of Pope seems issuing, like political revolutions,
in a despotism of its own making.</p>
<p>This, then, we cannot but think, distinguishes the literary period
of Shelley from our own.&nbsp; It distinguishes even the unquestionable
treasures and masterpieces of to-day from similar treasures and masterpieces
of the precedent day; even <i>the Lotus-Eaters</i> from <i>Kubla-Khan</i>;
even Rossetti&rsquo;s ballads from <i>Christabel</i>.&nbsp; It is present
in the restraint of Matthew Arnold no less than in the exuberance of
Swinburne, and affects our writers who aim at simplicity no less than
those who seek richness.&nbsp; Indeed, nothing is so artificial as our
simplicity.&nbsp; It is the simplicity of the French stage <i>ing&eacute;nue</i>.&nbsp;
We are self-conscious to the finger-tips; and this inherent quality,
entailing on our poetry the inevitable loss of spontaneity, ensures
that whatever poets, of whatever excellence, may be born to us from
the Shelleian stock, its founder&rsquo;s spirit can take among us no
reincarnation.&nbsp; An age that is ceasing to produce child-like children
cannot produce a Shelley.&nbsp; For both as poet and man he was essentially
a child.</p>
<p>Yet, just as in the effete French society before the Revolution the
Queen played at Arcadia, the King played at being a mechanic, everyone
played at simplicity and universal philanthropy, leaving for most durable
outcome of their philanthropy the guillotine, as the most durable outcome
of ours may be execution by electricity;&mdash;so in our own society
the talk of benevolence and the cult of childhood are the very fashion
of the hour.&nbsp; We, of this self-conscious, incredulous generation,
sentimentalise our children, analyse our children, think we are endowed
with a special capacity to sympathise and identify ourselves with children;
we play at being children.&nbsp; And the result is that we are not more
child-like, but our children are less child-like.&nbsp; It is so tiring
to stoop to the child, so much easier to lift the child up to you.&nbsp;
Know you what it is to be a child?&nbsp; It is to be something very
different from the man of to-day.&nbsp; It is to have a spirit yet streaming
from the waters of baptism; it is to believe in love, to believe in
loveliness, to believe in belief; it is to be so little that the elves
can reach to whisper in your ear; it is to turn pumpkins into coaches,
and mice into horses, lowness into loftiness, and nothing into everything,
for each child has its fairy godmother in its own soul; it is to live
in a nutshell and to count yourself the king of infinite space; it is</p>
<blockquote><p>To see a world in a grain of sand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a heaven in a wild flower,<br />
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eternity in an hour;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it is to know not as yet that you are under sentence of life, nor
petition that it be commuted into death.&nbsp; When we become conscious
in dreaming that we dream, the dream is on the point of breaking; when
we become conscious in living that we live, the ill dream is but just
beginning.&nbsp; Now if Shelley was but too conscious of the dream,
in other respects Dryden&rsquo;s false and famous line might have been
applied to him with very much less than it&rsquo;s usual untruth. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp;
To the last, in a degree uncommon even among poets, he retained the
idiosyncrasy of childhood, expanded and matured without differentiation.&nbsp;
To the last he was the enchanted child.</p>
<p>This was, as is well known, patent in his life.&nbsp; It is as really,
though perhaps less obviously, manifest in his poetry, the sincere effluence
of his life.&nbsp; And it may not, therefore, be amiss to consider whether
it was conditioned by anything beyond his congenital nature.&nbsp; For
our part, we believe it to have been equally largely the outcome of
his early and long isolation.&nbsp; Men given to retirement and abstract
study are notoriously liable to contract a certain degree of childlikeness:
and if this be the case when we segregate a man, how much more when
we segregate a child!&nbsp; It is when they are taken into the solution
of school-life that children, by the reciprocal interchange of influence
with their fellows, undergo the series of reactions which converts them
from children into boys and from boys into men.&nbsp; The intermediate
stage must be traversed to reach the final one.</p>
<p>Now Shelley never could have been a man, for he never was a boy.&nbsp;
And the reason lay in the persecution which overclouded his school-days.&nbsp;
Of that persecution&rsquo;s effect upon him, he has left us, in <i>The
Revolt of Islam</i>, a picture which to many or most people very probably
seems a poetical exaggeration; partly because Shelley appears to have
escaped physical brutality, partly because adults are inclined to smile
tenderly at childish sorrows which are not caused by physical suffering.&nbsp;
That he escaped for the most part bodily violence is nothing to the
purpose.&nbsp; It is the petty malignant annoyance recurring hour by
hour, day by day, month by month, until its accumulation becomes an
agony; it is this which is the most terrible weapon that boys have against
their fellow boy, who is powerless to shun it because, unlike the man,
he has virtually no privacy.&nbsp; His is the torture which the ancients
used, when they anointed their victim with honey and exposed him naked
to the restless fever of the flies.&nbsp; He is a little St. Sebastian,
sinking under the incessant flight of shafts which skilfully avoid the
vital parts.</p>
<p>We do not, therefore, suspect Shelley of exaggeration: he was, no
doubt, in terrible misery.&nbsp; Those who think otherwise must forget
their own past.&nbsp; Most people, we suppose, <i>must</i> forget what
they were like when they were children: otherwise they would know that
the griefs of their childhood were passionate abandonment, <i>d&eacute;chirants</i>
(to use a characteristically favourite phrase of modern French literature)
as the griefs of their maturity.&nbsp; Children&rsquo;s griefs are little,
certainly; but so is the child, so is its endurance, so is its field
of vision, while its nervous impressionability is keener than ours.&nbsp;
Grief is a matter of relativity; the sorrow should be estimated by its
proportion to the sorrower; a gash is as painful to one as an amputation
to another.&nbsp; Pour a puddle into a thimble, or an Atlantic into
Etna; both thimble and mountain overflow.&nbsp; Adult fools, would not
the angels smile at our griefs, were not angels too wise to smile at
them?</p>
<p>So beset, the child fled into the tower of his own soul, and raised
the drawbridge.&nbsp; He threw out a reserve, encysted in which he grew
to maturity unaffected by the intercourses that modify the maturity
of others into the thing we call a man.&nbsp; The encysted child developed
until it reached years of virility, until those later Oxford days in
which Hogg encountered it; then, bursting at once from its cyst and
the university, it swam into a world not illegitimately perplexed by
such a whim of the gods.&nbsp; It was, of course, only the completeness
and duration of this seclusion&mdash;lasting from the gate of boyhood
to the threshold of youth&mdash;which was peculiar to Shelley.&nbsp;
Most poets, probably, like most saints, are prepared for their mission
by an initial segregation, as the seed is buried to germinate: before
they can utter the oracle of poetry, they must first be divided from
the body of men.&nbsp; It is the severed head that makes the seraph.</p>
<p>Shelley&rsquo;s life frequently exhibits in him the magnified child.&nbsp;
It is seen in his fondness for apparently futile amusements, such as
the sailing of paper boats.&nbsp; This was, in the truest sense of the
word, child-like; not, as it is frequently called and considered, childish.&nbsp;
That is to say, it was not a mindless triviality, but the genuine child&rsquo;s
power of investing little things with imaginative interest; the same
power, though differently devoted, which produced much of his poetry.&nbsp;
Very possibly in the paper boat he saw the magic bark of Laon and Cythna,
or</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
thinnest boat<br />
In which the mother of the months is borne<br />
By ebbing night into her western cave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, if you mark how favourite an idea, under varying forms,
is this in his verse, you will perceive that all the charmed boats which
glide down the stream of his poetry are but glorified resurrections
of the little paper argosies which trembled down the Isis.</p>
<p>And the child appeared no less often in Shelley the philosopher than
in Shelley the idler.&nbsp; It is seen in his repellent no less than
in his amiable weaknesses; in the unteachable folly of a love that made
its goal its starting-point, and firmly expected spiritual rest from
each new divinity, though it had found none from the divinities antecedent.&nbsp;
For we are clear that this was no mere straying of sensual appetite,
but a straying, strange and deplorable, of the spirit; that (contrary
to what Mr. Coventry Patmore has said) he left a woman not because he
was tired of her arms, but because he was tired of her soul.&nbsp; When
he found Mary Shelley wanting, he seems to have fallen into the mistake
of Wordsworth, who complained in a charming piece of unreasonableness
that his wife&rsquo;s love, which had been a fountain, was now only
a well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Such change, and at the very door<br />
Of my fond heart, hath made me poor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wordsworth probably learned, what Shelley was incapable of learning,
that love can never permanently be a fountain.&nbsp; A living poet,
in an article <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a> which
you almost fear to breathe upon lest you should flutter some of the
frail pastel-like bloom, has said the thing: &ldquo;Love itself has
tidal moments, lapses and flows due to the metrical rule of the interior
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elementary reason should proclaim this true.&nbsp;
Love is an affection, its display an emotion: love is the air, its display
is the wind.&nbsp; An affection may be constant; an emotion can no more
be constant than the wind can constantly blow.&nbsp; All, therefore,
that a man can reasonably ask of his wife is that her love should be
indeed a well.&nbsp; A well; but a Bethesda-well, into which from time
to time the angel of tenderness descends to trouble the waters for the
healing of the beloved.&nbsp; Such a love Shelley&rsquo;s second wife
appears unquestionably to have given him.&nbsp; Nay, she was content
that he should veer while she remained true; she companioned him intellectually,
shared his views, entered into his aspirations, and yet&mdash;yet, even
at the date of <i>Epipsychidion</i> the foolish child, her husband,
assigned her the part of moon to Emilia Viviani&rsquo;s sun, and lamented
that he was barred from final, certain, irreversible happiness by a
cold and callous society.&nbsp; Yet few poets were so mated before,
and no poet was so mated afterwards, until Browning stooped and picked
up a fair-coined soul that lay rusting in a pool of tears.</p>
<p>In truth, his very unhappiness and discontent with life, in so far
as it was not the inevitable penalty of the ethical anarch, can only
be ascribed to this same child-like irrationality&mdash;though in such
a form it is irrationality hardly peculiar to Shelley.&nbsp; Pity, if
you will, his spiritual ruins and the neglected early training which
was largely their cause; but the pity due to his outward circumstances
has been strangely exaggerated.&nbsp; The obloquy from which he suffered
he deliberately and wantonly courted.&nbsp; For the rest, his lot was
one that many a young poet might envy.&nbsp; He had faithful friends,
a faithful wife, an income small but assured.&nbsp; Poverty never dictated
to his pen; the designs on his bright imagination were never etched
by the sharp fumes of necessity.</p>
<p>If, as has chanced to others&mdash;as chanced, for example, to Mangan&mdash;outcast
from home, health and hope, with a charred past and a bleared future,
an anchorite without detachment and self-cloistered without self-sufficingness,
deposed from a world which he had not abdicated, pierced with thorns
which formed no crown, a poet hopeless of the bays and a martyr hopeless
of the palm, a land cursed against the dews of love, an exile banned
and proscribed even from the innocent arms of childhood&mdash;he were
burning helpless at the stake of his unquenchable heart, then he might
have been inconsolable, then might he have cast the gorge at life, then
have cowered in the darkening chamber of his being, tapestried with
mouldering hopes, and hearkened to the winds that swept across the illimitable
wastes of death.&nbsp; But no such hapless lot was Shelley&rsquo;s as
that of his own contemporaries&mdash;Keats, half chewed in the jaws
of London and spit dying on to Italy; de Quincey, who, if he escaped,
escaped rent and maimed from those cruel jaws; Coleridge, whom they
dully mumbled for the major portion of his life.&nbsp; Shelley had competence,
poetry, love; yet he wailed that he could lie down like a tired child
and weep away his life of care.&nbsp; Is it ever so with you, sad brother;
is it ever so with me? and is there no drinking of pearls except they
be dissolved in biting tears?&nbsp; &ldquo;Which of us has his desire,
or having it is satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that he shared the fate of nearly all the great poets
contemporary with him, in being unappreciated.&nbsp; Like them, he suffered
from critics who were for ever shearing the wild tresses of poetry between
rusty rules, who could never see a literary bough project beyond the
trim level of its day but they must lop it with a crooked criticism,
who kept indomitably planting in the defile of fame the &ldquo;established
canons&rdquo; that had been spiked by poet after poet.&nbsp; But we
decline to believe that a singer of Shelley&rsquo;s calibre could be
seriously grieved by want of vogue.&nbsp; Not that we suppose him to
have found consolation in that senseless superstition, &ldquo;the applause
of posterity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Posterity! posterity which goes to Rome,
weeps large-sized tears, carves beautiful inscriptions over the tomb
of Keats; and the worm must wriggle her curtsey to it all, since the
dead boy, wherever he be, has quite other gear to tend.&nbsp; Never
a bone less dry for all the tears!</p>
<p>A poet must to some extent be a chameleon and feed on air.&nbsp;
But it need not be the musty breath of the multitude.&nbsp; He can find
his needful support in the judgement of those whose judgement he knows
valuable, and such support Shelley had:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La gloire<br />
Ne compte pas toujours les voix;<br />
Elle les p&egrave;se quelquefois.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet if this might be needful to him as support, neither this, nor
the applause of the present, nor the applause of posterity, could have
been needful to him as motive: the one all-sufficing motive for a great
poet&rsquo;s singing is that expressed by Keats:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was taught in Paradise<br />
To ease my breast of melodies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Precisely so.&nbsp; The overcharged breast can find no ease but in
suckling the baby-song.&nbsp; No enmity of outward circumstances, therefore,
but his own nature, was responsible for Shelley&rsquo;s doom.</p>
<p>A being with so much about it of child-like unreasonableness, and
yet withal so much of the beautiful attraction luminous in a child&rsquo;s
sweet unreasonableness, would seem fore-fated by its very essence to
the transience of the bubble and the rainbow, of all things filmy and
fair.&nbsp; Did some shadow of this destiny bear part in his sadness?&nbsp;
Certain it is that, by a curious chance, he himself in <i>Julian and
Maddalo</i> jestingly foretold the manner of his end.&nbsp; &ldquo;O
ho!&nbsp; You talk as in years past,&rdquo; said Maddalo (Byron) to
Julian (Shelley); &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t swim, Beware of Providence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Did no unearthly <i>dixisti</i> sound in his ears as he wrote it?&nbsp;
But a brief while, and Shelley, who could not swim, was weltering on
the waters of Lerici.&nbsp; We know not how this may affect others,
but over us it is a coincidence which has long tyrannised with an absorbing
inveteracy of impression (strengthened rather than diminished by the
contrast between the levity of the utterance and its fatal fulfilment)&mdash;thus
to behold, heralding itself in warning mockery through the very lips
of its predestined victim, the Doom upon whose breath his locks were
lifting along the coasts of Campania.&nbsp; The death which he had prophesied
came upon him, and Spezzia enrolled another name among the mournful
Marcelli of our tongue; Venetian glasses which foamed and burst before
the poisoned wine of life had risen to their brims.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Coming to Shelley&rsquo;s poetry, we peep over the wild mask of revolutionary
metaphysics, and we see the winsome face of the child.&nbsp; Perhaps
none of his poems is more purely and typically Shelleian than <i>The
Cloud</i>, and it is interesting to note how essentially it springs
from the faculty of make-believe.&nbsp; The same thing is conspicuous,
though less purely conspicuous, throughout his singing; it is the child&rsquo;s
faculty of make-believe raised to the nth power.&nbsp; He is still at
play, save only that his play is such as manhood stops to watch, and
his playthings are those which the gods give their children.&nbsp; The
universe is his box of toys.&nbsp; He dabbles his fingers in the day-fall.&nbsp;
He is gold-dusty with tumbling amidst the stars.&nbsp; He makes bright
mischief with the moon.&nbsp; The meteors nuzzle their noses in his
hand.&nbsp; He teases into growling the kennelled thunder, and laughs
at the shaking of its fiery chain.&nbsp; He dances in and out of the
gates of heaven: its floor is littered with his broken fancies.&nbsp;
He runs wild over the fields of ether.&nbsp; He chases the rolling world.&nbsp;
He gets between the feet of the horses of the sun.&nbsp; He stands in
the lap of patient Nature and twines her loosened tresses after a hundred
wilful fashions, to see how she will look nicest in his song.</p>
<p>This it was which, in spite of his essentially modern character as
a singer, qualified Shelley to be the poet of <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>,
for it made him, in the truest sense of the word, a mythological poet.&nbsp;
This child-like quality assimilated him to the child-like peoples among
whom mythologies have their rise.&nbsp; Those Nature myths which, according
to many, are the basis of all mythology, are likewise the very basis
of Shelley&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; The lark that is the gossip of heaven,
the winds that pluck the grey from the beards of the billows, the clouds
that are snorted from the sea&rsquo;s broad nostril, all the elemental
spirits of Nature, take from his verse perpetual incarnation and reincarnation,
pass in a thousand glorious transmigrations through the radiant forms
of his imagery.</p>
<p>Thus, but not in the Wordsworthian sense, he is a veritable poet
of Nature.&nbsp; For with Nature the Wordsworthians will admit no tampering:
they exact the direct interpretative reproduction of her; that the poet
should follow her as a mistress, not use her as a handmaid.&nbsp; To
such following of Nature, Shelley felt no call.&nbsp; He saw in her
not a picture set for his copying, but a palette set for his brush;
not a habitation prepared for his inhabiting, but a Coliseum whence
he might quarry stones for his own palaces.&nbsp; Even in his descriptive
passages the dream-character of his scenery is notorious; it is not
the clear, recognisable scenery of Wordsworth, but a landscape that
hovers athwart the heat and haze arising from his crackling fantasies.&nbsp;
The materials for such visionary Edens have evidently been accumulated
from direct experience, but they are recomposed by him into such scenes
as never had mortal eye beheld.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you
had?&rdquo; as Turner said.&nbsp; The one justification for classing
Shelley with the Lake poet is that he loved Nature with a love even
more passionate, though perhaps less profound.&nbsp; Wordsworth&rsquo;s
<i>Nightingale and Stockdove</i> sums up the contrast between the two,
as though it had been written for such a purpose.&nbsp; Shelley is the
&ldquo;creature of ebullient heart,&rdquo; who</p>
<blockquote><p>Sings as if the god of wine<br />
Had helped him to a valentine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wordsworth&rsquo;s is the</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;Love with quiet blending,<br />
Slow to begin and never ending,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the &ldquo;serious faith and inward glee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Shelley, instead of culling Nature, crossed with its pollen
the blossoms of his own soul, that Babylonian garden is his marvellous
and best apology.&nbsp; For astounding figurative opulence he yields
only to Shakespeare, and even to Shakespeare not in absolute fecundity
but in images.&nbsp; The sources of his figurative wealth are specialised,
sources of Shakespeare&rsquo;s are universal.&nbsp; It would have been
as conscious an effort for him to speak without figure as it is for
most men to speak with figure.&nbsp; Suspended in the dripping well
of his imagination the commonest object becomes encrusted with imagery.&nbsp;
Herein again he deviates from the true Nature poet, the normal Wordsworth
type of Nature poet: imagery was to him not a mere means of expression,
not even a mere means of adornment; it was a delight for its own sake.</p>
<p>And herein we find the trail by which we would classify him.&nbsp;
He belongs to a school of which not impossibly he may hardly have read
a line&mdash;the Metaphysical School.&nbsp; To a large extent he <i>is</i>
what the Metaphysical School should have been.&nbsp; That school was
a certain kind of poetry trying for a range.&nbsp; Shelley is the range
found.&nbsp; Crashaw and Shelley sprang from the same seed; but in the
one case the seed was choked with thorns, in the other case it fell
on good ground.&nbsp; The Metaphysical School was in its direct results
an abortive movement, though indirectly much came of it&mdash;for Dryden
came of it.&nbsp; Dryden, to a greater extent than is (we imagine) generally
perceived, was Cowley systematised; and Cowley, who sank into the arms
of Dryden, rose from the lap of Donne.</p>
<p>But the movement was so abortive that few will thank us for connecting
with it the name of Shelley.&nbsp; This is because to most people the
Metaphysical School means Donne, whereas it ought to mean Crashaw.&nbsp;
We judge the direction of a development by its highest form, though
that form may have been produced but once, and produced imperfectly.&nbsp;
Now the highest product of the Metaphysical School was Crashaw, and
Crashaw was a Shelley <i>manqu&eacute;</i>; he never reached the Promised
Land, but he had fervid visions of it.&nbsp; The Metaphysical School,
like Shelley, loved imagery for its own sake: and how beautiful a thing
the frank toying with imagery may be, let <i>The Skylark</i> and <i>The
Cloud</i> witness.&nbsp; It is only evil when the poet, on the straight
way to a fixed object, lags continually from the path to play.&nbsp;
This is commendable neither in poet nor errand-boy.&nbsp; The Metaphysical
School failed, not because it toyed with imagery, but because it toyed
with it frostily.&nbsp; To sport with the tangles of Ne&aelig;ra&rsquo;s
hair may be trivial idleness or caressing tenderness, exactly as your
relation to Ne&aelig;ra is that of heartless gallantry or of love.&nbsp;
So you may toy with imagery in mere intellectual ingenuity, and then
you might as well go write acrostics: or you may toy with it in raptures,
and then you may write a <i>Sensitive Plant</i>.&nbsp; In fact, the
Metaphysical poets when they went astray cannot be said to have done
anything so dainty as is implied by <i>toying</i> with imagery.&nbsp;
They cut it into shapes with a pair of scissors.&nbsp; From all such
danger Shelley was saved by his passionate spontaneity.&nbsp; No trappings
are too splendid for the swift steeds of sunrise.&nbsp; His sword-hilt
may be rough with jewels, but it is the hilt of an Excalibur.&nbsp;
His thoughts scorch through all the folds of expression.&nbsp; His cloth
of gold bursts at the flexures, and shows the naked poetry.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It is this gift of not merely embodying but apprehending everything
in figure which co-operates towards creating his rarest characteristics,
so almost preternaturally developed in no other poet, namely, his well-known
power to condense the most hydrogenic abstraction.&nbsp; Science can
now educe threads of such exquisite tenuity that only the feet of the
tiniest infant-spiders can ascend them; but up the filmiest insubstantiality
Shelley runs with agile ease.&nbsp; To him, in truth, nothing is abstract.&nbsp;
The dustiest abstractions</p>
<blockquote><p>Start, and tremble under his feet,<br />
And blossom in purple and red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The coldest moon of an idea rises haloed through his vaporous imagination.&nbsp;
The dimmest-sparked chip of a conception blazes and scintillates in
the subtile oxygen of his mind.&nbsp; The most wrinkled &AElig;son of
an abstruseness leaps rosy out of his bubbling genius.&nbsp; In a more
intensified signification than it is probable that Shakespeare dreamed
of, Shelley gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.&nbsp;
Here afresh he touches the Metaphysical School, whose very title was
drawn from this habitual pursuit of abstractions, and who failed in
that pursuit from the one cause omnipresent with them, because in all
their poetic smithy they had left never a place for a forge.&nbsp; They
laid their fancies chill on the anvil.&nbsp; Crashaw, indeed, partially
anticipated Shelley&rsquo;s success, and yet further did a later poet,
so much further that we find it difficult to understand why a generation
that worships Shelley should be reviving Gray, yet almost forget the
name of Collins.&nbsp; The generality of readers, when they know him
at all, usually know him by his <i>Ode on the Passions</i>.&nbsp; In
this, despite its beauty, there is still a <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of
formalism, a lingering trace of powder from the eighteenth century periwig,
dimming the bright locks of poetry.&nbsp; Only the literary student
reads that little masterpiece, the <i>Ode to Evening</i>, which sometimes
heralds the Shelleian strain, while other passages are the sole things
in the language comparable to the miniatures of <i>Il Penseroso</i>.&nbsp;
Crashaw, Collins, Shelley&mdash;three ricochets of the one pebble, three
jets from three bounds of the one Pegasus!&nbsp; Collins&rsquo;s Pity,
&ldquo;with eyes of dewy light,&rdquo; is near of kin to Shelley&rsquo;s
Sleep, &ldquo;the filmy-eyed&rdquo;; and the &ldquo;shadowy tribes of
mind&rdquo; are the lineal progenitors of &ldquo;Thought&rsquo;s crowned
powers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, however, is personification, wherein both
Collins and Shelley build on Spenser: the dizzying achievement to which
the modern poet carried personification accounts for but a moiety, if
a large moiety, of his vivifying power over abstractions.&nbsp; Take
the passage (already alluded to) in that glorious chorus telling how
the Hours come</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the temples high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of man&rsquo;s ear and eye<br />
Roofed over Sculpture and Poesy,</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From those skiey towers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Thought&rsquo;s crowned powers<br />
Sit watching your dance, ye happy Hours!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our feet now, every palm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are sandalled with calm,<br />
And the dew of our wings is a rain of balm;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And beyond our eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The human love lies<br />
Which makes all it gazes on Paradise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any partial explanation will break in our hands before it reaches
the root of such a power.&nbsp; The root, we take it, is this.&nbsp;
He had an instinctive perception (immense in range and fertility, astonishing
for its delicate intuition) of the underlying analogies the secret subterranean
passages, between matter and soul; the chromatic scales, whereat we
dimly guess, by which the Almighty modulates through all the keys of
creation.&nbsp; Because, the more we consider it, the more likely does
it appear that Nature is but an imperfect actress, whose constant changes
of dress never change her manner and method, who is the same in all
her parts.</p>
<p>To Shelley&rsquo;s ethereal vision the most rarified mental or spiritual
music traced its beautiful corresponding forms on the sand of outward
things.&nbsp; He stood thus at the very junction-lines of the visible
and invisible, and could shift the points as he willed.&nbsp; His thoughts
became a mounted infantry, passing with baffling swiftness from horse
to foot or foot to horse.&nbsp; He could express as he listed the material
and the immaterial in terms of each other.&nbsp; Never has a poet in
the past rivalled him as regards this gift, and hardly will any poet
rival him as regards it in the future: men are like first to see the
promised doom lay its hand on the tree of heaven and shake down the
golden leaves. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a></p>
<p>The finest specimens of this faculty are probably to be sought in
that Shelleian treasury, <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>.&nbsp; It is unquestionably
the greatest and most prodigal exhibition of Shelley&rsquo;s powers,
this amazing lyric world, where immortal clarities sigh past in the
perfumes of the blossoms, populate the breathings of the breeze, throng
and twinkle in the leaves that twirl upon the bough; where the very
grass is all a-rustle with lovely spirit-things, and a weeping mist
of music fills the air.&nbsp; The final scenes especially are such a
Bacchic reel and rout and revelry of beauty as leaves one staggered
and giddy; poetry is spilt like wine, music runs to drunken waste.&nbsp;
The choruses sweep down the wind, tirelessly, flight after flight, till
the breathless soul almost cries for respite from the unrolling splendours.&nbsp;
Yet these scenes, so wonderful from a purely poetical standpoint that
no one could wish them away, are (to our humble thinking) nevertheless
the artistic error of the poem.&nbsp; Abstractedly, the development
of Shelley&rsquo;s idea required that he should show the earthly paradise
which was to follow the fall of Zeus.&nbsp; But dramatically with that
fall the action ceases, and the drama should have ceased with it.&nbsp;
A final chorus, or choral series, of rejoicings (such as does ultimately
end the drama where Prometheus appears on the scene) would have been
legitimate enough.&nbsp; Instead, however, the bewildered reader finds
the drama unfolding itself through scene after scene which leaves the
action precisely where it found it, because there is no longer an action
to advance.&nbsp; It is as if the choral <i>finale</i> of an opera were
prolonged through two acts.</p>
<p>We have, nevertheless, called <i>Prometheus</i> Shelley&rsquo;s greatest
poem because it is the most comprehensive storehouse of his power.&nbsp;
Were we asked to name the most <i>perfect</i> among his longer efforts,
we should name the poem in which he lamented Keats: under the shed petals
of his lovely fancy giving the slain bird a silken burial.&nbsp; Seldom
is the death of a poet mourned in true poetry.&nbsp; Not often is the
singer coffined in laurel-wood.&nbsp; Among the very few exceptions
to such a rule, the greatest is <i>Adonais</i>.&nbsp; In the English
language only <i>Lycidas</i> competes with it; and when we prefer <i>Adonais</i>
to <i>Lycidas</i>, we are following the precedent set in the case of
Cicero: <i>Adonais</i> is the longer.&nbsp; As regards command over
abstraction, it is no less characteristically Shelleian than <i>Prometheus</i>.&nbsp;
It is throughout a series of abstractions vitalised with daring exquisiteness,
from Morning who sought:</p>
<blockquote><p>Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound,<br />
Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and who</p>
<blockquote><p>Dimmed the aerial eyes that kindle day,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to the Dreams that were the flock of the dead shepherd, the Dreams</p>
<blockquote><p>Whom near the living streams<br />
Of his young spirit he fed; and whom he taught<br />
The love that was its music;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of whom one sees, as she hangs mourning over him,</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon the silken fringe of his faint eyes,<br />
Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies<br />
A tear some dream has loosened from his brain!<br />
Lost angel of a ruined Paradise!<br />
She knew not &rsquo;twas her own; as with no stain<br />
She faded like a cloud which hath outwept its rain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the solar spectrum, beyond the extreme red and extreme violet
rays, are whole series of colours, demonstrable, but imperceptible to
gross human vision.&nbsp; Such writing as this we have quoted renders
visible the invisibilities of imaginative colour.</p>
<p>One thing prevents <i>Adonais</i> from being ideally perfect: its
lack of Christian hope.&nbsp; Yet we remember well the writer of a popular
memoir on Keats proposing as &ldquo;the best consolation for the mind
pained by this sad record&rdquo; Shelley&rsquo;s inexpressibly sad exposition
of Pantheistic immortality:</p>
<blockquote><p>He is a portion of the loveliness<br />
Which once he made more lovely, <i>etc</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What desolation can it be that discerns comfort in this hope, whose
wan countenance is as the countenance of a despair?&nbsp; What deepest
depth of agony is it that finds consolation in this immortality: an
immortality which thrusts you into death, the maw of Nature, that your
dissolved elements may circulate through her veins?</p>
<p>Yet such, the poet tells me, is my sole balm for the hurts of life.&nbsp;
I am as the vocal breath floating from an organ.&nbsp; I too shall fade
on the winds, a cadence soon forgotten.&nbsp; So I dissolve and die,
and am lost in the ears of men: the particles of my being twine in newer
melodies, and from my one death arise a hundred lives.&nbsp; Why, through
the thin partition of this consolation Pantheism can hear the groans
of its neighbour, Pessimism.&nbsp; Better almost the black resignation
which the fatalist draws from his own hopelessness, from the fierce
kisses of misery that hiss against his tears.</p>
<p>With some gleams, it is true, of more than mock solace, <i>Adonais</i>
is lighted; but they are obtained by implicitly assuming the personal
immortality which the poem explicitly denies; as when, for instance,
to greet the dead youth,</p>
<blockquote><p>The inheritors of unfulfilled renown<br />
Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought<br />
Far in the unapparent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again the final stanza of the poem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The breath whose might I have invoked in song<br />
Descends on me; my spirit&rsquo;s bark is driven<br />
Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng<br />
Whose sails were never to the tempest riven;<br />
The massy earth, the spher&egrave;d skies are given:<br />
I am borne darkly, fearfully afar;<br />
Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of heaven,<br />
The soul of Adonais like a star<br />
Beacons from the abode where the eternal are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Soul of Adonais?&mdash;Adonais, who is but</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the
loveliness<br />
Which once he made more lovely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all, to finish where we began, perhaps the poems on which the
lover of Shelley leans most lovingly, which he has oftenest in his mind,
which best represent Shelley to him and which he instinctively reverts
to when Shelley&rsquo;s name is mentioned are some of the shorter poems
and detached lyrics.&nbsp; Here Shelley forgets for a while all that
ever makes his verse turbid; forgets that he is anything but a poet,
forgets sometimes that he is anything but a child; lies back in his
skiff, and looks at the clouds.&nbsp; He plays truant from earth, slips
through the wicket of fancy into heaven&rsquo;s meadow, and goes gathering
stars.&nbsp; Here we have that absolute virgin-gold of song which is
the scarcest among human products, and for which we can go to but three
poets&mdash;Coleridge, Shelley, Chopin, <a name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8">{8}</a>
and perhaps we should add Keats.&nbsp; <i>Christabel</i> and <i>Kubla-Khan</i>;
<i>The Skylark</i>, <i>The Cloud</i>, and <i>The Sensitive Plant</i>
(in its first two parts).&nbsp; <i>The Eve of Saint Agnes</i> and <i>The
Nightingale</i>; certain of the Nocturnes;&mdash;these things make very
quintessentialised loveliness.&nbsp; It is attar of poetry.</p>
<p>Remark, as a thing worth remarking, that, although Shelley&rsquo;s
diction is at other times singularly rich, it ceases in these poems
to be rich, or to obtrude itself at all; it is imperceptible; his Muse
has become a veritable Echo, whose body has dissolved from about her
voice.&nbsp; Indeed, when his diction is richest, nevertheless the poetry
so dominates the expression that we feel the latter only as an atmosphere
until we are satiated with the former; then we discover with surprise
to how imperial a vesture we had been blinded by gazing on the face
of his song.&nbsp; A lesson, this, deserving to be conned by a generation
so opposite in tendency as our own: a lesson that in poetry, as in the
Kingdom of God, we should not take thought too greatly wherewith we
shall be clothed, but seek first <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9">{9}</a>
the spirit, and all these things will be added unto us.</p>
<p>On the marvellous music of Shelley&rsquo;s verse we need not dwell,
except to note that he avoids that metronomic beat of rhythm which Edgar
Poe introduced into modern lyric measures, as Pope introduced it into
the rhyming heroics of his day.&nbsp; Our varied metres are becoming
as painfully over-polished as Pope&rsquo;s one metre.&nbsp; Shelley
could at need sacrifice smoothness to fitness.&nbsp; He could write
an anap&aelig;st that would send Mr. Swinburne into strong shudders
(e.g., &ldquo;stream did glide&rdquo;) when he instinctively felt that
by so forgoing the more obvious music of melody he would better secure
the higher music of harmony.&nbsp; If we have to add that in other ways
he was far from escaping the defects of his merits, and would sometimes
have to acknowledge that his Nilotic flood too often overflowed its
banks, what is this but saying that he died young?</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It may be thought that in our casual comments on Shelley&rsquo;s
life we have been blind to its evil side.&nbsp; That, however, is not
the case.&nbsp; We see clearly that he committed grave sins, and one
cruel crime; but we remember also that he was an Atheist from his boyhood;
we reflect how gross must have been the moral neglect in the training
of a child who <i>could</i> be an Atheist from his boyhood: and we decline
to judge so unhappy a being by the rules which we should apply to a
Catholic.&nbsp; It seems to us that Shelley was struggling&mdash;blindly,
weakly, stumblingly, but still struggling&mdash;towards higher things.&nbsp;
His Pantheism is an indication of it.&nbsp; Pantheism is a half-way
house, and marks ascent or descent according to the direction from which
it is approached.&nbsp; Now Shelley came to it from absolute Atheism;
therefore in his case it meant rise.&nbsp; Again, his poetry alone would
lead us to the same conclusion, for we do not believe that a truly corrupted
spirit can write consistently ethereal poetry.&nbsp; We should believe
in nothing, if we believed that, for it would be the consecration of
a lie.&nbsp; Poetry is a thermometer: by taking its average height you
can estimate the normal temperature of its writer&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp;
The devil can do many things.&nbsp; But the devil cannot write poetry.&nbsp;
He may mar a poet, but he cannot make a poet.&nbsp; Among all the temptations
wherewith he tempted St. Anthony, though we have often seen it stated
that he howled, we have never seen it stated that he sang.</p>
<p>Shelley&rsquo;s anarchic principles were as a rule held by him with
some misdirected view to truth.&nbsp; He disbelieved in kings.&nbsp;
And is it not a mere fact&mdash;regret it if you will&mdash;that in
all European countries, except two, monarchs are a mere survival, the
obsolete buttons on the coat-tails of rule, which serve no purpose but
to be continually coming off?&nbsp; It is a miserable thing to note
how every little Balkan State, having obtained liberty (save the mark!)
by Act of Congress, straightway proceeds to secure the service of a
professional king.&nbsp; These gentlemen are plentiful in Europe.&nbsp;
They are the &ldquo;noble Chairmen&rdquo; who lend their names for a
consideration to any enterprising company which may be speculating in
Liberty.&nbsp; When we see these things, we revert to the old lines
in which Persius tells how you cannot turn Dama into a freeman by twirling
him round your finger and calling him Marcus Dama.</p>
<p>Again, Shelley desired a religion of humanity, and that meant, to
him, a religion for humanity, a religion which, unlike the spectral
Christianity about him, should permeate and regulate the whole organisation
of men.&nbsp; And the feeling is one with which a Catholic must sympathise,
in an age when&mdash;if we may say so without irreverence&mdash;the
Almighty has been made a constitutional Deity, with certain state-grants
of worship, but no influence over political affairs.&nbsp; In these
matters his aims were generous, if his methods were perniciously mistaken.&nbsp;
In his theory of Free Love alone, borrowed like the rest from the Revolution,
his aim was as mischievous as his method.&nbsp; At the same time he
was at least logical.&nbsp; His theory was repulsive, but comprehensible.&nbsp;
Whereas from our present <i>via media</i>&mdash;facilitation of divorce&mdash;can
only result the era when the young lady in reduced circumstances will
no longer turn governess but will be open to engagement as wife at a
reasonable stipend.</p>
<p>We spoke of the purity of Shelley&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; We know of
but three passages to which exception can be taken.&nbsp; One is happily
hidden under a heap of Shelleian rubbish.&nbsp; Another is offensive,
because it presents his theory of Free Love in its most odious form.&nbsp;
The third is very much a matter, we think, for the individual conscience.&nbsp;
Compare with this the genuinely corrupt Byron, through the cracks and
fissures of whose heaving versification steam up perpetually the sulphurous
vapours from his central iniquity.&nbsp; We cannot credit that any Christian
ever had his faith shaken through reading Shelley, unless his faith
were shaken before he read Shelley.&nbsp; Is any safely havened bark
likely to slip its cable, and make for a flag planted on the very reef
where the planter himself was wrecked?</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Why indeed (one is tempted to ask in concluding) should it be that
the poets who have written for us the poetry richest in skiey grain,
most free from admixture with the duller things of earth&mdash;the Shelleys,
the Coleridges, the Keats&mdash;are the very poets whose lives are among
the saddest records in literature?&nbsp; Is it that (by some subtile
mystery of analogy) sorrow, passion, and fantasy are indissolubly connected,
like water, fire, and cloud; that as from sun and dew are born the vapours,
so from fire and tears ascend the &ldquo;visions of a&euml;rial joy&rdquo;;
that the harvest waves richest over the battlefields of the soul; that
the heart, like the earth, smells sweetest after rain; that the spell
on which depend such necromantic castles is some spirit of pain charm-poisoned
at their base? <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10">{10}</a>&nbsp;
Such a poet, it may be, mists with sighs the window of his life until
the tears run down it; then some air of searching poetry, like an air
of searching frost, turns it to a crystal wonder.&nbsp; The god of golden
song is the god, too, of the golden sun; so peradventure song-light
is like sunlight, and darkens the countenance of the soul.&nbsp; Perhaps
the rays are to the stars what thorns are to the flowers; and so the
poet, after wandering over heaven, returns with bleeding feet.&nbsp;
Less tragic in its merely temporal aspect than the life of Keats or
Coleridge, the life of Shelley in its moral aspect is, perhaps, more
tragical than that of either; his dying seems a myth, a figure of his
living; the material shipwreck a figure of the immaterial.</p>
<p>Enchanted child, born into a world unchildlike; spoiled darling of
Nature, playmate of her elemental daughters; &ldquo;pard-like spirit,
beautiful and swift,&rdquo; laired amidst the burning fastnesses of
his own fervid mind; bold foot along the verges of precipitous dream;
light leaper from crag to crag of inaccessible fancies; towering Genius,
whose soul rose like a ladder between heaven and earth with the angels
of song ascending and descending it;&mdash;he is shrunken into the little
vessel of death, and sealed with the unshatterable seal of doom, and
cast down deep below the rolling tides of Time.&nbsp; Mighty meat for
little guests, when the heart of Shelley was laid in the cemetery of
Caius Cestius!&nbsp; Beauty, music, sweetness, tears&mdash;the mouth
of the worm has fed of them all.&nbsp; Into that sacred bridal-gloom
of death where he holds his nuptials with eternity let not our rash
speculations follow him.&nbsp; Let us hope rather that as, amidst material
nature, where our dull eyes see only ruin, the finer eye of science
has discovered life in putridity and vigour in decay,&mdash;seeing dissolution
even and disintegration, which in the mouth of man symbolise disorder,
to be in the works of God undeviating order, and the manner of our corruption
to be no less wonderful than the manner of our health,&mdash;so, amidst
the supernatural universe, some tender undreamed surprise of life in
doom awaited that wild nature, which, worn by warfare with itself, its
Maker, and all the world, now</p>
<blockquote><p>Sleeps, and never palates more the dug,<br />
The beggar&rsquo;s nurse, and C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s.</p>

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
